Suporting the Hobbes'-natural-state simulation project posts in dotlegal.nl. 
In the dotlegal.nl blog I leave a trace of messages that log my efforts in providing an agent-based simulation model that (1) allows to investigate how the state of wars of each against everyone can emerge and be sustained and that (2) allows to demonstrate how agent based models can be used to demonstrate (Hobbes)/falsify (Popper) axiomatic theories.  

In the current state of the project I am following the COVID-19 weekly registered data on cases and deaths (in ---data.nls). The seven dated .nlogo files are presenting tableau information for 6 jurisdictions and one for global. These are made available because I consider what is currently happening with the USA-PRC exending trade war and the Trump-Biden extending election war and the social-media supported explosion of successful phishing in social (conspiracy theories), governmental (IT-based security risks), economic (bitcoin) and technological (AI-miracles) arenas as possibly leading up to the situations that Hobbes feared.

Also in the current state of the project I am preparing how to set up a world for the Hobbesian project. That is why the NatState.V01.nlogo file is made available here too.
