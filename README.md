Suporting the Hobbes'-natural-state simulation project posts in dotlegal.nl. 
In the dotlegal.nl blog I leave a trace of messages that log my efforts in providing an agent-based simulation model that (1) allows to investigate how the state of wars of each against everyone can emerge and be sustained and that (2) allows to demonstrate how agent based models can be used to demonstrate (Hobbes)/falsify (Popper) axiomatic theories.
